# snake
A traditional Snake game, using only what System.Console class offers for rendering. That means a lot of Console.WriteLine() and Console.Clear().

I also use System.Threading for realtime input and to add an interval between write and clear cicles.
The game also features a Leaderboard in a .txt file, with up to 10 top scores.
